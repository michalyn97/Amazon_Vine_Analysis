# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# OverView
The purpose of this project was to select an "Amazing Vine" dataset, (I selected the Beauty Product dataset) and use the ETL process
to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.

# Results

# Summary
With nearly 60% of the beauty product reviews being upaid, the data appears to be unbaised 5 star reviews.  
We could also compare the total number of verified to unverified purchases and review the data to see if that may affect the results.
